# LofaBlog
Blogging website for the organization LOFA

I had a part time affiliation with LOFA, in which I was in content creation team. My project specifically was to create this blog web via wordpress.

- Configured navigation, content and hosting.
- Worked with content creation team of LOFA, designed theme and the website as per the need of the organization.
- Taught the team members to use, manage and create contents in this website.
